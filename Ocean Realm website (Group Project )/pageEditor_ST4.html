                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        The profile.html page is structured with a
                        &lt;head> section that includes metadata, styles, and a favicon. The navigation bar uses an
                        unordered list (&lt;ul>) with hover cards for extra details. The main profile section consists
                        of a sidebar and content area. The sidebar features a profile picture, name, quote,
                        personal details, and skill progress bars. The main content area presents a bio, goals,
                        frustrations, and experience. The layout is styled with .container for centering and
                        shadow effects, .sidebar for a distinct background and circular profile image, and
                        .main-content for readability. Skills are displayed using .skill-bar elements with
                        dynamic widths. Interactive elements like .calendar-container and .table-container are
                        hidden by default and appear on hover. The calendar uses grid-template-columns for
                        alignment, while animations like @keyframes fadeIn enhance transitions. The design
                        ensures clarity, usability, and responsiveness.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        The profile.html page addresses accessibility by using semantic HTML elements like
                        &lt;nav>, &lt;section>, &lt;table>, &lt;form>, and &lt;footer> to improve screen reader
                        compatibility
                        and provide a clear structure. Images, including the profile picture and logo, have
                        descriptive alt text to assist visually impaired users. The page ensures proper color
                        contrast between text and background, enhancing readability. Buttons and interactive
                        elements have clear labels and hover effects for better user guidance. The form fields
                        include &lt;label> elements associated with inputs, making them easier to navigate with
                        assistive technologies. Additionally, responsive design principles ensure the page
                        adapts well to different screen sizes, improving accessibility across devices.

                <section>
                    <!-- page editor section for sitemap -->
                    <h2 id="sitemap">SiteMap Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The page starts with the &lt;head&gt; section, including metadata, a viewport setting for
                        responsiveness, a favicon, and external/internal stylesheets. The &lt;body&gt; contains a title
                        (&lt;h1&gt;) and a .structure div that organizes navigation buttons into horizontal and vertical
                        sections. The buttons, wrapped in &lt;a&gt; tags, link to different site pages. The page also
                        uses &lt;svg&gt; elements with &lt;line&gt; to create visual connectors, enhancing the sitemap's
                        clarity.

                        The body has a background image (background-image) covering the entire page (background-size:
                        cover). The .container and .structure use display: flex to arrange elements neatly. Buttons
                        (.button) are styled with padding, shadows, and border-radius for a clean look, with a hover
                        effect (:hover { background-color: lightgray; }). The svg elements use absolute positioning
                        (position: absolute;) to ensure correct alignment of connector lines.

                        The design ensures easy navigation with a structured button layout and SVG-based visual
                        connectors. Flexbox provides responsive alignment, and hover effects enhance interactivity. The
                        background image adds visual appeal without sacrificing readability. These techniques create an
                        intuitive and accessible sitemap.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>In implementing accessibility on this page, I ensured that key elements followed best practices
                        for usability. The page structure uses semantic HTML, including a &lt;h1&gt; heading for clear
                        page identification. A readable sans-serif font was chosen, and text contrast was maintained by
                        using black text on a white button background, ensuring readability. Navigation buttons are
                        styled with sufficient size and spacing for easy clicking, reducing issues for users with motor
                        impairments. Additionally, links are structured with descriptive text rather than generic
                        phrases, making them more accessible for screen readers. The page layout also incorporates
                        flexible containers and a responsive design approach using &lt;div&gt; elements with `flexbox`,
                        allowing for a well-structured experience across various screen sizes. The &lt;meta&gt; viewport
                        tag ensures proper scaling on mobile devices. However, improvements such as adding `aria-labels`
                        to interactive elements and ensuring proper keyboard navigation would further enhance
                        accessibility.</p>

                    <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>This page is structured using semantic HTML and styled with CSS to create a visually appealing
                        and functional layout. The &lt;head> section includes essential meta tags for character encoding
                        and viewport settings to ensure proper scaling across devices. A favicon is also linked to
                        enhance branding.
                        The page layout relies on div> elements with flexbox properties such as display: flex and
                        flex-direction: column to ensure a well-organized, responsive structure. The .container class
                        uses padding, margin, and a semi-transparent background-color to create a readable content area
                        that stands out against the page background.
                        For typography, &lt;h1> and &lt;h2> elements are styled with distinct font sizes and colors to
                        create a hierarchy, improving readability. The text content within &lt;p> tags is styled with
                        appropriate line-height and padding to enhance legibility. The use of color: white ensures
                        contrast against the dark background.
                        The navigation bar uses a &lt;nav> element containing a structured &lt;ul> list with links for
                        easy navigation. Each menu item features a hover effect with additional details inside a
                        .hover-card, enhancing user engagement.
                        Images are placed inside .image-container elements, with max-width: 50% and border-radius: 15px
                        to ensure they scale properly while maintaining a polished, rounded appearance.
                        The footer section contains copyright information and additional navigation links. Overall, the
                        combination of semantic HTML and structured CSS creates an accessible, well-organized, and
                        visually appealing webpage.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>This page improves accessibility using semantic HTML like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and
                        &lt;footer&gt; for better screen reader navigation. Proper heading structure and high-contrast
                        text enhance readability. Navigation links are inside a &lt;ul&gt; for accessibility, and images
                        include descriptive `alt` text. `Flexbox` ensures a responsive layout, and the &lt;meta
                        viewport&gt; tag allows proper scaling. Hover effects provide extra context, improving
                        usability. Adding `aria-labels` and enhancing keyboard navigation could further improve
                        accessibility.</p>

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>Challenges included ensuring responsiveness, maintaining readability on all devices, and
                        optimizing navigation for accessibility. Implementing proper contrast and semantic HTML was
                        essential. Lessons learned: structuring content with &lt;flexbox&gt; improves adaptability,
                        `alt` text enhances inclusivity, and small accessibility tweaks greatly impact usability. Future
                        work includes refining keyboard navigation.</p>

                <section>
                    <!-- compliance parts -->
                    <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The pages created align with Janet regulations governing web publication by ensuring
                        accessibility, security, and responsible content management. Accessibility is addressed through
                        semantic HTML, proper heading structures, `alt` text for images, and a responsive design that
                        adapts to different devices. Compliance with security guidelines includes avoiding inline
                        scripts and ensuring external stylesheets are properly linked, reducing vulnerabilities.

                        Content is structured logically, promoting clarity and ease of navigation, which aligns with
                        best practices for usability. The inclusion of a &lt;meta viewport&gt; tag ensures mobile
                        compatibility, fulfilling accessibility requirements. However, improvements such as implementing
                        `aria-labels`, enhancing keyboard navigation, and ensuring full compliance with WCAG standards
                        could further strengthen accessibility.

                        To meet content responsibility regulations, the pages avoid harmful, misleading, or offensive
                        material and provide accurate, relevant information. Any future updates should include security
                        audits, privacy considerations, and continuous accessibility improvements to fully align with
                        Janet's evolving web publication standards.</p>
